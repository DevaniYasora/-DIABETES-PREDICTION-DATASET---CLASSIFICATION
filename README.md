Objective:
To thoroughly understand and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is clean, relevant, and well-structured for modeling.

To determine the most relevant features that contribute to the prediction of diabetes and create new features that may improve the modelâ€™s performance.

The objective of this project is to develop a robust model for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information.

Data Mining problem:
To develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes based on a range of demographic and medical attributes.

About the dataset:

Age: Age is an important factor in predicting diabetes risk. As individuals get older, their risk of developing diabetes increases. This is partly due to factors such as reduced physical activity, changes in hormone levels, and a higher likelihood of developing other health conditions that can contribute to diabetes.

Gender: Gender can play a role in diabetes risk, although the effect may vary. For example, women with a history of gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Additionally, some studies have suggested that men may have a slightly higher risk of diabetes compared to women.

Body Mass Index (BMI): BMI is a measure of body fat based on a person's height and weight. It is commonly used as an indicator of overall weight status and can be helpful in predicting diabetes risk. Higher BMI is associated with a greater likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. Excess body fat, particularly around the waist, can lead to insulin resistance and impair the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels.

Hypertension: Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition that often coexists with diabetes. The two conditions share common risk factors and can contribute to each other's development. Having hypertension increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and vice versa. Both conditions can have detrimental effects on cardiovascular health.

Heart Disease: Heart disease, including conditions such as coronary artery disease and heart failure, is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. The relationship between heart disease and diabetes is bidirectional, meaning that having one condition increases the risk of developing the other. This is because they share many common risk factors, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.

Smoking History: Smoking is a modifiable risk factor for diabetes. Cigarette smoking has been found to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Smoking can contribute to insulin resistance and impair glucose metabolism. Quitting smoking can significantly reduce the risk of developing diabetes and its complications.

HbA1c Level: HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) is a measure of the average blood glucose level over the past 2-3 months. It provides information about long-term blood sugar control. Higher HbA1c levels indicate poorer glycemic control and are associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes and its complications.

Blood Glucose Level: Blood glucose level refers to the amount of glucose (sugar) present in the blood at a given time. Elevated blood glucose levels, particularly in the fasting state or after consuming carbohydrates, can indicate impaired glucose regulation and increase the risk of developing diabetes. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is important in the diagnosis and management of diabetes.

Diabetes: Presnce or absent of diabetes.
